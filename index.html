                    Filling routine life with fun and thrill can be understood as an adventure. 
                    The future is unpredictable. For some people, the meaning of adventure revolves around it. 
                    Activities performed without thinking of the outcomes can be defined as an adventure. 
                    There is not a definite definition of adventure.

                    Christy Raedeke said, “If there is no risk, there is no reward.” 
                    This suggests that a bit of risk is necessary for the possibility of a reward. 
                    Adventurous trips, a financial decision, starting a new venture, or even quitting a job to chase a passion—these are all examples of adventure in general life. 
                    Adventure is about making a self-inspired move away from the routine days.
